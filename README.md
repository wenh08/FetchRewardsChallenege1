# FetchRewardsChallenege1 This app was created as part of the Fetch Rewards coding challenge. The task was to create a recipe app that uses the themealdb.com 's API. The app was to include 3 API end points for getting the Categories of the meals which are Beef, Chicken, SeaFood Etc. The next goal of the challenge was to display the list of meals within its respective Category, therefore, when a user clicks on a Category, they're taken to a Page that displays each meal within that category. After, the user is then able to select a meal and see the details of the cooking the meal such as Its instructions, ingredients , and measurements for making the selected meal. This project was created by using a collection view to display both the Categories of items, and list of meals, A view Controller was used to display the meal detail.
